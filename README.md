Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, SVM, and an ensemble of these methods were used and compared to classify breast cancer data as benign or malignant based on cancer cell features such as mean size, texture, and smoothness. Accuracies of 94-100% were achieved on the test dataset using a voting classifier based on all of the above classifiers.

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set was obtained from Kaggle/UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
